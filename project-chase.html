All participants had no problem with the task. Still, all of them were interested in where this feature would be in the app, so the prototype should begin with the main Chase app screen test the user flow and if this feature will be noticeable within the existing app.</p>

                                <p>The feedback from the usability testing showed that there was a lot of interest in having a budget feature rolled into one’s own mobile banking app, since all of the users interviewed and surveyed indicated they are utilizing this to keep a tab on their finances.   </p>

<p>If I had more time, I would have tested more ideas, conducted further testing, and found out how to trigger more interest in users for saving money using budget features within the banking app.
The most critical point would be to evaluate how well users understand the budgeting concepts.
If this feature were to be put into production, I would monitor how many users continuously use this app over time and for how long they use it before dropping it off. I would also keep track of metrics on the goals that users set for themselves and their rate of accomplishment.
Furthermore, through this personal finance management feature, I would monitor the number of users who sign up for additional Chase services. With each stage along the user journey, monitoring metrics provides the opportunity to adjust the app to serve both the users and the business better.</p>
